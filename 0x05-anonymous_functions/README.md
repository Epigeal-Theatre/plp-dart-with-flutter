Anonymous Functions 


In the previous lesson we introduced you to functions that are defined by using a function name like main(), fullName(). In this lesson we will talk about nameless functions or functions without a name. This type of function is known as an anonymous function, lambda, or closure. An anonymous function behaves the same as a regular function, but it does not have a name with it. It can have zero or any number of arguments / parameters with an option type annotation
