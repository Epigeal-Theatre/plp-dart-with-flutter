this is my readme file for the topic data types in dart topic.
Learning Objectives


To understand what data type is
To understand different data types in DART programming
Be able to code with the different data types
A data type is an attribute of data which tells the compiler or interpreter how the programmer intends to use the data.

Dart supports the following data types:

Number
Strings
Boolean
Lists
Maps
Runes
Null




Numbers
When you need to store numeric value on dart, you can use either int or double. Both int and double are subtypes of num. Int stores whole numbers while double stores decimal numbers.

String
String helps you to store text data in your program. You can use single or double quotes to store string in dart.



Booleans
In Dart, boolean holds either true or false value. You can write the bool keyword to define the boolean data type. You can use boolean if the answer is true or false. Consider the answer to the following questions:

Are you asleep?
Is the door open?
Does a cat fly?
Are you older than your father?
These all are yes/no questions. Its a good idea to store them in boolean

Lists
Dart List is similar to an array, which is the ordered collection of the objects. If you want to store multiple values without creating multiple variables, you can use a list.

Maps
A map is a dynamic collection that represents a set of values ​as key-value pairs. Keys and values ​in the

map can be of any type.

Runes
A rune can be defined as an integer used to represent any Unicode code point. As a Dart string is a simple sequence of UTF-16 code units, 32-bit Unicode values in a string are represented using a special syntax.

Arithmetic Operations using Numbers
Arithmetic operators are the most common types of operators. They perform operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division.
