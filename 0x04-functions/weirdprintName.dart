 * now here is another weird function i dont even understand its application
 * 
 * but I know that the function takes no parameters and has no return type. 
 * all it does is print whateve r you want it to print on the screen.
 * to be honest i dont understand why it is implemented outside of the main function and then called later, or maybe i do!
