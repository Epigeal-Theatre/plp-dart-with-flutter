Be able to understand types of functions in Dart


FUNCTIONS

In this tutorial, you will learn about functions in dart. Functions are the block of code that performs a specific task. They are created when some statements are repeatedly occurring in the program. The function helps reusability of the code in the program.



Function Advantages
Avoid Code Repetition
Easy to divide the complex program into smaller parts
Helps to write a clean code
Syntax of a function
returntype functionName(parameter1,parameter2, ...){


// function body

}



Return type: It tells you the function output type. It can be void, String, int, double, etc. If the function doesnâ€™t return anything, you can use void as the return type.

Function Name: You can name functions by almost any name. Always follow a lowerCamelCase naming convention like void printName().

Parameters: Parameters are the input to the function, which you can write inside the bracket (). Always follow a lowerCamelCase naming convention for your function parameter.



Example 1: Function That Prints Name
This is a simple program that prints name using function. The name of function is printName().



Key Points
In dart function are also objects.
You should follow the lowerCamelCase naming convention while naming function.
You should follow the lowerCamelCase naming convention while naming function parameters.


Types Of Functions
Functions are the block of code that performs a specific task. Here are different types of functions:

No Parameter And No Return Type
Parameter And No Return Type
No Parameter And Return Type
Parameter And Return Type
